Build a fully responsive, professional website for a Discord community called Hiverse.
The site should have a dark, multiverse aesthetic with dark blue, blue, and black as main colors. The UI should look sleek, clean, and professional with subtle animations and smooth transitions.

üß≠ Navbar:

Logo centered at the top, shaped as a circle, with navigation links on left and right of the logo, like a professional game navbar.

Subtle blue aura around the logo, no flashy rainbow effects.

Links: Home, About, Giveaways, Features, Join Us.

Navbar fixed on scroll, clean design, subtle hover effects.

üåå Home Section:

Background: dark galaxy/multiverse with subtle particles.

Hiverse name in sleek typography, centered.

Join Now button linking to https://discord.gg/JQ9RyTvE8w, minimal glow for CTA.

Smooth entrance animation, slight parallax optional.

üëë About Section:

Owners: Kuzma and Hamza, shown in round profile cards, clean layout, minimal glow border.

Include name, role (‚ÄúFounder of Hiverse‚Äù), short description.

Profile data editable in code.

üéÅ Giveaways Section:

Section with cards showing ongoing/past giveaways, clean professional layout.

Each card: image, title, description, Join Giveaway button.

Back-Office for Admins:

Hidden in footer bottom-left as ‚ÄúGiveaways Admin‚Äù button.

Opens password popup; password = Hiverse2025.

Admin panel allows:

Add New Giveaway: title, description, image URL, end date/time

End Giveaway: list active giveaways, end them manually

Adding/ending giveaways triggers Discord webhook to post info in the server automatically (title, description, image).

Clean, minimal design matching the professional multiverse theme.

‚öôÔ∏è Features Section:

List key features with small icons & subtle accent color:

Active Community

Server name, member count, online members

Join Now button to https://discord.gg/JQ9RyTvE8w

Subtle fade-in/out animation, minimal design.

üì± Responsiveness:

Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, mobile.

Navbar collapses to hamburger on small screens, logo stays centered.

‚ö° Tech / Style:

Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if allowed).

Subtle animations, smooth transitions, minimal effects.

Focus on professional, sleek look, not over-the-top glowing or disco vibes.

Back-office password, webhook system, admin controls fully integrated but hidden from regular users.
